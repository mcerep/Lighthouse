    "You might be wondering how we calculate the statistical significance of peaks in a periodogram. There are several other peaks in our plots; why shouldn't we believe them? Similarly, why *should* we believe that the highest peak is real?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we're going to use a technique called bootstrapping. Say we know that a given peak in our periodogram has a height $H$. We want to calculate the significance of that peak. We do so by carrying out the following procedure a bunch of times:\n",
    "1. Create a new, fake signal generated by randomly rearranging the values assigned to each day. This signal consists of random noise.\n",
    "2. Compute the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of that signal.\n",
    "3. Calculate the highest point on that periodogram, and denote its height $H_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following through those steps many times, we can assign a significance called a $p$-value to our original peak. Here, the $p$-value is the fraction of the fake signals with $H_i$ greater than or equal to $H$. For instance, if we randomize the data 100 times and 66 of them have $H_i\\geq H$, we would say that the $p$-value is $66/100=0.66$. Typically, we want $p$ to be below a certain threshold to say that the peak is significant. $0.05$ is a common choice in some scenarios. Since $0.66$ is much greater than $0.05$, we conclude that this peak is not significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate a $p$-value for the periodicity we found, using `.autopower()` and $n=10000$ simulations. Here are some hints to help you:\n",
    "- You can find the maximum value of an array using `np.max()`.\n",
    "- You can create a shuffled copy of `obs_signal` with `fake_signal = np.copy(obs_signal)` and then `np.random.shuffle(fake_signal)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the peak might be so strong that none of the simulations produce a peak that high!"
