**Lighthouse** is a series of Python notebooks (in progress) intended for those with little to no coding experience to become 
familiarized with basic Python functionalities and libraries commonly used in astronomy. These notebooks are intended to help Pulsar 
Science Collaboratory students more easily join advanced research groups, but anyone interested in learning is welcome to use them as well!

Please note that these are Jupyter notebooks, so students will need someone to help them set up the appropriate environment to run them before starting.
