**Lighthouse** is a series of Jupyter notebooks (in progress) intended for those with little to no coding experience to become 
familiarized with basic Python functionalities and libraries commonly used in astronomy. These notebooks are intended to help Pulsar 
Science Collaboratory students more easily join advanced research groups, but anyone interested in learning is welcome to use them as well!

Each notebook has a regular version, where portions of the code are left empty for the student to fill out, and an answer key version, where those 
sections are completed with example solutions.

**Lighthouse Part 1** covers the basics of Python, including data types and how to modify them, functions, conditional logic, for loops, while loops, and a short challenge.

**Lighthouse Part 2** covers the basic functionalities of NumPy and Matplotlib and then walks the user through creating and phase folding pulsar data using NumPy and Matplotlib.

Please note that these are Jupyter notebooks, so students will need someone to help them set up the appropriate environment to run them before starting.
